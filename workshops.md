We love teaching and we love hackathons, so we combined those things into Design Workshops.

A Great Job workshop means that we will collaborate with your team on your product in an instense, fast-paced work environment. We teach our design methodology hands-on, and we do real work with your team. 

We bring the intensity and momentum of a hackathon into our workshops. They typically last 1-3 days and involve a cross-disciplinary team. We are flexible with the format, and each workshop will be tailored to your needs.

Our goal is to get a ton of work done and equip your team with what it needs to continue moving the project forward after the workshop. We are always impressed by what can be accomplished using this format, and we know that you will be as well.
