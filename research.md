title: Research & Prototyping
---

We use the scientific method to solve problems, because we know that it works. Effective problem solving requires experimentation and testing, that's why scientists do it.

Research will help you understand the problem you are trying to solve and the people you are trying to solve it for. Prototyping will validate whether or not you are actually solving the problem.

###The Process

**Observation**

We research the problem, the problem space, and the people involved. This means that we actually talk to people. We ask them about how they feel, how they currently solve the problem, their frustrations, what delights them, etc. This ensures that we can design real solutions for real people.

**Hypothesis**

We use simple brainstorming techniques to form ideas about the people, the problem, and the solution.

**Experimentation**

We create prototypes and watch people use them. These prototypes could be sketches, clickable interfaces, simple games we create, anything that gets the job done.

**Analysis**

We analyze the results of our experiments using some techniques such as customer journey maps, more prototypes and testing, or more interviews.


**Conclusion**

When we are sure that we have a solution that works, we document it with flow diagrams and sketches/wireframes. Then we build it.
